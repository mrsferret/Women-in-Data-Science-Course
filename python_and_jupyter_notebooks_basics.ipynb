This is reflected in the name of the language, which is named after Monty Python's Flying Circus - not the snake!\n",
        "\n",
        "Part of the reason Python is popular is that it's an easy language for beginners, while still being powerful enough to be used in many real life situations. I would say the three main areas where Python is used:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Creating websites - the back end of many websites run using a web framework like *Django* or *Flask* which are written in Python.\n",
        "2. Scripting - this means creating small programs to do little tasks on your computer.\n",
        "3. Analysing data - which is what we'll be doing in this course!\n",
        "\n",
        "For data analysis and interactive, exploratory computing and data visualization, Python will inevitably draw comparisons with the many other domain-specific open source (designed to be publicly accessible) and commercial programming languages and tools in wide use, such as R, MATLAB, SAS, Stata, and others. \n",

        "Python is **general purpose programming language**. This means that it is not designed to serve only a specific purpose. In contrast to languages like R or SAS, Python was not designed to serve the purpose of \"statistics\" or \"data analysis\". As such, Python does require a little more training to get started with, but there is no ceiling to what you can do with Python. Because it is a general purpose programming language, it means if you ever need to work in a different language like Java for some reason, your background in Python will give you a good conceptual foundation. \n",
        "\n",
        "As a language, Python has a clear, readable syntax. Perhaps its most notable feature is its use of whitespace to denote blocks of code, rather than the curly brackets that you might see in other programming languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its community places quite an emphasis on aesthetics. It's common to hear code being described as _Pythonic_ - this is code that meets the community's idea of how Python code should be. This philosophy is laid out in a document called [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#id3).\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two versions of Python available: Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 was an update to Python 2 that isn't backwards compatible. So code written in Python 2 won't necessarily run in Python 3. Python 2 is no longer supported (as of January 2020!) so if you have the choice you should avoid using it.\n",

        "Jupyter is an open source platform that contains a suite of tools but we will be focusing on **Jupyter Notebooks** today. This is a browser-based application (so you can access it through a web browser such as Google Chrome etc.) that allows you to create and share documents (i.e. Jupyter Notebook files) that contain descriptive text, code blocks and code output (such as data visualisations) in a single file. The Jupyter Notebook file format is `.ipynb `. When you run the code, it generates the outputs, including plots and tables, within the notebook file. You can then export the notebook to a `.pdf` or `.html` that can then be shared with anyone. \n",
        "\n",
        "You can use Jupyter Notebooks to document workflows and to share code for data processing, analysis and visualization all in the one place. For data analysts and scientists, that format can drive exploration as it creates an environment in which users execute code, see what happens, modify and repeat in a kind of iterative conversation between the analyst and the data. \n",

        "\n",
        "Computational notebooks have been around for decades, but Jupyter in particular has exploded in popularity over the past couple of years. This rapid uptake has been aided by the ability to code in different langauges within Jupyter — a fact reflected in its name, which was inspired, according to co-founder Fernando Pérez, by the programming languages Julia `(Ju)`, Python `(Py)` and `R`."
